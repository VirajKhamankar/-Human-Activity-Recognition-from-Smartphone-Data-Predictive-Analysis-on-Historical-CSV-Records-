# Discription 


The project uses a dataset of accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from 30 subjects performing six different activities:
•	Walking
•	Walking upstairs
•	Walking downstairs
•	Sitting
•	Standing
•	Lying down
The first step in the project is to clean the data and remove any rows that contain missing values. The next step is to perform feature selection to identify the most important features for activity recognition. This is done using the SelectKBest algorithm, which selects the top k features based on their statistical significance.
The final step is to train a machine learning model to classify the activities. The code trains four different models: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and random forest. The accuracy of each model is evaluated on a test set.
The project description is as follows:
This project uses a dataset of accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from 30 subjects performing six different activities. The data is cleaned and preprocessed, and then feature selection is used to identify the most important features for activity recognition. Four machine learning models are trained to classify the activities, and their accuracy is evaluated on a test set.
The results show that the random forest model achieves the highest accuracy of   96.7%. This suggests that the random forest model is the best model for this task.
